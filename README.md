## Detailed description

This is a demo webpage, that I originally designed to introduce my sister's handmade 
jewelry to a wider audience.

The landing page is a good place to put your company slogan or a short description. On the navigation bar, you can also find the product page and a contact page.

On the product page, you can find product cards, that reposition themselves, when the screen size changes. Each card has a photo window, that can have one or multiple photos about the product. You can navigate between these photos with the "View more" button. Below the image, you can find the product name and price followed by the description. All cards change their size based on how long the description is and you can have as many or few of them as you like.

The contact page consists of a contact form that is linked to my email account. The form has a honeypot to avoid spam. After submitting the message, you will be shown a success page. In the creation of the contact form, I used an API called formSubmit. You can find out more about them here: https://formsubmit.co/

Additionally, everything on this page is scalable and works well on any device size.
